# CMPINF001-version-control
Skill lab 6 for CMPINF001

### What is does
This project takes two word from the user input. If the first word is included in the second word, we tell the user that the first word is included in the second word and how many times the first word is included in the second word. Else, if the first word is not included in the second word, we tell the user that the first word is not included in the second word.

### How to contribute
Anyone is welcomed to make changes to the source code. Please make annotations as necessary.

### Code snippet of how to use it
#### input user‘s first word
word_A = input("Please enter a word: ")
#### input user’s second word
word_B = input("Please enter another word: ")

Simply enter two words into terminal, and the program will run. 

### Miscellany
We chose to use MIT license because it is permissive that it's both business and open-source friendly. We also used contributor covenant as code of conduct for our project since it is friendely to ethical source communities.
