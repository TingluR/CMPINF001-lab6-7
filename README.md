# CMPINF001-version-control
Skill lab 6 for CMPINF001

This project takes two word from the user input. If the first word is included in the second word, we tell the user that the first word is included in the second word and how many times the first word is included in the second word. Else, if the first word is not included in the second word, we tell the user that the first word is not included in the second word.

### Miscellany
We chose to use MIT license because it is permissive that it's both business and open-source friendly. We also used contributor covenant as code of conduct for our project since it is friendely to ethical source communities.
